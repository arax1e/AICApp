This app shows a search bar whwere the user can search for anything and the results will show all of the artworks that the Art Institute of Chicago has in its collection related to that query. 

## How to Use
In order to use this app, the user will need to download the code and run it on a local server. 

## Future Improvements
In the future, I would like to add greater functionality to this app, including linking to the Art Institute's website, displaying other information about the artwork, and even showing images.
